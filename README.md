# Uni-Install
an "easier" way to download/install custom programs

Uni means Universal btw

### If you don't know, how to edit it, look at ``config.toml``, its very easy (i think, i made many comments in this config)
If you want to don't see ``config.toml`` in standalone uni-installer.exe, then build it yourself using ``pyinstaller`` or ``auto-py-to-exe``

When using ``auto-py-to-exe``, theres an ``exe_config.json`` to import as configuration!
